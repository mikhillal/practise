This is a sample program that sort a list of numbers using bubble sort algorithm. 
This program takes a list of numbers as input and sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. 
The outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop runs n-i-1 times, where i is the current iteration of the outer loop. 
The if statement checks if the current number is greater than the next number, and if it is, they are swapped. 
The sorted list is returned as the result of the function.
